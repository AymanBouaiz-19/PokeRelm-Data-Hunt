## 🚀 What is PokeGenius?

**PokeGenius** is a real-time, AI-powered Pokédex web platform built by a first-year AI & Software Engineering student as a personal challenge to integrate advanced technologies into a seamless, world-class digital product.

Designed with a product-first mindset, the platform combines:
- Real-time data rendering
- Smart AI-driven recommendations
- Futuristic UI/UX
- Multi-language support (Arabic, English, French)
- Cloud-first deployment architecture

🧠 It's more than a Pokémon viewer — it's a showcase of **intelligence, creativity, and real engineering**.
